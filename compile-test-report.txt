PURPOSE
========================================================================

Kernel compilation is generally a good stress test of a system. The
primary question to be answered is:

1. Can the RK3399 SoC handle the rigor of kernel compilation?

Additional questions I wished to answer were:

2. Do the thermal characteristics of the SoC remain in the recommended
   range throughout kernel compilation?

Based on review of the datasheet, it appears the core frequencies are
throttled when 80 degrees Celsius is exceeded.

3. Do the GPU and SoC temperatures differ significantly?

My assumption is that since both are on the same chip, that they will
reach equilibrium under constant load.

4. Does the system, under heavy load, discharge the battery while
   attached to the power supply?

This claim was made in the Pine64 Pinebook Pro forums:

PROCEDURES
========================================================================

This is a summary of the steps taken to conduct the tests. A detailed
account of the steps taken can be found in:

  compiling-kernel-on-pinebook.txt

1. Created systemd-nspawn container on portable drive to isolate the
   compilation from the system and to restrict writes to that drive to
   limit writing to eMMC.

2. Installed kernel compilation software requirements in container:

   - build-essential
   - git
   - python
   - bc
   - libssl-dev

3. Downloaded kernel sources into container.

4. Wrote bash script to perform kernel compilation and collect data
   during test.

5. Compiled kernel starting with -j1 and increasing by steps of 1 to
   -j6 through each successive test. Data was collected through each
   run.

6. Wrote awk script to summarize collected data.


DATA
========================================================================

Testing occurred on November 18, 2019 roughly between 5:45 PM EST and
10:00 PM EST.

The ambient room temperature during testing was 22 degrees Celsius.

Raw data for each run was collected separately with the exception of the
first run which not only failed during compilation, but an error in the
script resulted in no data being collected. The collected raw data is in
separate log files:

  compile-test_{2,3,4,5,6,7}.log

ANALYSIS
========================================================================

The maximum temperature value of the GPU during all runs was 64.4
degrees Celsius, while that of the SoC was 73.9. These maximums were
recorded during run #7 while compiling with -j6. According to the RK3399
datasheet the SoC begins throttling at 80 degrees Celsius.

The average temperature differential between gpu-thermal and soc-thermal
is calculated from the average temperatures of both the average
temperature values of both gpu-thermal and soc-thermal during each run.
The calculation is abs(Tgpu_avg - Tsoc_avg). For all runs, the minimum
average difference between Tgpu and Tsoc is 3.3 degrees Celsius, while
the maximum average difference between the two is 8.0 degrees Celsius.

The average voltage_now of the battery during the six runs that produced
data was 4.2 V with the exception of run #2 which calculated an average
voltage_now (Tbat_avg) of 4.1V. Significant discharge of the battery was
not observed when comparing the Vbat_begin and Vbat_end for each run
along with Vbat_avg. There was a marginally larger difference between
Vbat_begin and Vbat_end for the second and third runs. Run #2 had an
additional inactive terminal open, it is unknown what may have
contributed to that larger difference in Run #3.


DISCUSSION
========================================================================

So can the RK3399 SoC in the Pinebook Pro platform handle the rigor of
kernel compilation? The Pinebook Pro under test experienced no reboots,
freezes, or lockups during any of the test runs, including compilation
with -j6 on the last run. The Pinebook Pro can handle the rigors of
kernel compilation.

Data collected during all test runs shows definitively that even when
compiling the kernel with -j6, the SoC and GPU remain within the
recommended temperature range throughout compilation. This additionally
strengthens the argument that the Pinebook Pro can handle the rigors of
kernel compilation.

The data also showed that there is normally a clear difference between
the temperature of the GPU and the SoC, and that they do not appear to
reach equilibrium even while the SoC experiences heavy load while
compiling the kernel with -j6. My beginning hypothesis was that it would
not matter whether gpu-thermal or soc-thermal was measured because
during high load they would come to equilibrium. This was not what the
test results showed. The RK3399 and Pinebook Pro provide enough passive
heat dissipation that thermal equilibrium between GPU and SoC did not
occur at higher temperatures.

The batteries reported voltage_now was collected during all tests to
look for a constant drop in voltage which would indicate that the
Pinebook Pro with its provided DC adapter was drawing more power under
high load than the system could provide while plugged in. It is also
important to note that this compilation occurred on and while an
external USB hard drive was attached and drawing power from the
Pinebook Pro. Minor fluctuations were observed but the Pinebook Pro was
able to compile a kernel with -j6 and not significantly discharge the
battery while under high load.


CONCLUSION
========================================================================

It was found that the Pinebook Pro is fully capable of compiling a
Linux kernel, which is commonly used by some to stress test a new system
to determine if there are any potential hardware issues. This indicates
That the Pinebook Pro is capable of real work, and not simply a toy.
